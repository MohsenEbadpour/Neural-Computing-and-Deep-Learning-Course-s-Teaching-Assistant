# Neural Computing and Deep Learning Course's Teaching Assistant
In the Fall of 2022 and Spring of 2023, I was the teaching assistant for the Neural Computing and Deep Learning course held at **[Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en)** by **[Prof. Safabakhsh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFsdqo8AAAAJ&hl=en)**. My responsibilities included project definition, question designing, and grading based on reports of students and their presentation.
