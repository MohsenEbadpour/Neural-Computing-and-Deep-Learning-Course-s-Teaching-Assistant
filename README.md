# Neural Computing and Deep Learning Course's Teaching Assistant
In the Fall of 2022 and Spring of 2023, I was the teaching assistant for the Neural Computing and Deep Learning course held at **[Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en)** by **[Prof. Safabakhsh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFsdqo8AAAAJ&hl=en)**. My responsibilities included project definition, question designing, and grading based on reports of students and their presentation.

List of covered topics in projects are as follows in Spring 2022:
- Homework #1
> Adaline Neuron, Perceptron Neuron, Classification with single Neuron, Second-Order Neurons
- Homework #2
> Multilayer perceptron, Training the neural network, Activation functions, Batch based updating rule, Preprocessing, Outlier detection, Overfitting, Generalization
- Homework #3
> Self-organizing map, Surface Reconstruction, Clustering, U-Matrix
- Homework #4
> Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Transfer Learning, Residual Connection, ResNet, DenseNet, Kernel visualization, Inception module, Vanishing gradient, Exploding gradient
- Homework #5
> Autoencoders, Recurrent neural network, Anomaly detection, Data windowing
- Homework #6
> Long short-term memory(LSTM), Gated recurrent units (GRUs) , Sentiment analysis, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Word embedding
- Homework #7
> Generative Adversarial Network, Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, Mode Collapse , Diminished gradient
- Homework #8
> Transformer Network, Sentiment analysis, BERT, Self-Attention, Cross-Attention
